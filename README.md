# 1D-2D-FEA-using-Matlab
Description:
A MATLAB GUI for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) supporting 2D and 1D simulations. This tool allows users to model various shapes (beam, square, circle, rhombus), include voids or inclusions, and choose different element types for meshing. Additionally, users can analyze structural behavior with modes such as extension, expansion, and shear.

Key Features:
✓ 2D and 1D Finite Element Analysis
✓ Object options: Beam, Square, Circle, Rhombus
✓ Inclusion/void modeling
✓ Force output modes: Extension, Expansion, Shear
✓ Flexible meshing with selectable element types


How to Use:
1) Select the desired object shape and specify parameters.
2) Choose inclusion or void options if needed.
3) Set force output mode: Extension, Expansion, or Shear.
4) Select the element type for meshing.
5) Run the simulation and analyze the results.
